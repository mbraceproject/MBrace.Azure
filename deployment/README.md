# MBrace Deployment with Azure Resource Manager
Deploy an MBrace cluster to Azure as an App Service webjob along with all of the required additional Azure dependencies.

## How to use
1. Open up a Powershell window.
2. CD to this directory.
3. Execute the following commands:

```lang=powershell
## Logs into Azure using your credentials - no need for pub setting 
Login-AzureRmAccount

## Create a "resource group" for the cluster, called MyCluster
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name MyCluster -Location "North Europe"

4. You will notice the output of this operation will contain the Service Bus and Storage Account keys - these can be used to connect to the cluster.

5. You can easily fine tune the process as follows:

## Optional, if you have multiple subscriptions
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionName "My Subscription"

## Create an 'small' MBrace cluster called MyCluster
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName MyCluster -TemplateFile .\azuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile "small-cluster.json"

## Resize the cluster to a 'medium' sized cluster (2 nodes)
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName MyCluster -TemplateFile .\azuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile "medium-cluster.json"

## Manually configure the cluster size to 8 large nodes (S3 = large)
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName MyCluster -TemplateFile .\azuredeploy.json -clusterSize 8 -nodeSize S3

## Destroy the cluster
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name "MyCluster"
```

## Benefits over Cloud Service deployment
* Rapid provisioning / deprovisioning
* Code-free - no requirements for MBrace to use MAML to provision a cluster
* Simpler model for cluster provisioning with ready-made "small" "medium" and "large" cluster parameter files.
* Built in Azure diagnostics / charting within the Portal
* Fully supported by Microsoft going forwards
* Easier management - a single MBrace Worker executable / package that is accessible over HTTP can function across
all node sizes, unlike Cloud Services. Packages are simple zip files - no need to create cspackages.

## Restrictions
* Requires PowerShell currently. This could be removed using the .NET ARM SDK
* As this implementation of MBrace runs in a web job in the Azure App Service, it does not have admin privileges. Therefore, it cannot retrieve PerfMon
counters for the purposes of metrics e.g. ``ShowWorkers()``.
